# ✅ Flickering Issue - FIXED!

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

Your Basketball Tournament website had flickering issues caused by:
1. **Continuous re-renders** in LiveScoreboard component
2. **Timer updates** triggering full component re-renders
3. **Layout animations** conflicting with state updates
4. **Layout shifts** from dynamic content width changes

---

## 🔧 Changes Applied

### 1. **LiveScoreboard.js** - Complete Optimization

#### Added Change Detection:
```javascript
// Now checks if data actually changed before updating
const hasChanged = !prevData || 
  data.scoreA !== prevData.scoreA ||
  data.scoreB !== prevData.scoreB ||
  // ... other meaningful fields

// Only update if something meaningful changed
if (hasChanged || !prevData) {
  setMatchData(data);
}
```

#### Added Memoization:
```javascript
// Player lists are now memoized - won't recalculate unless players change
const teamAPlayers = useMemo(() => {
  if (!matchData?.players) return [];
  return Object.entries(matchData.players).filter(([_, player]) => player.team === 'A');
}, [matchData?.players]);
```

#### Created Memoized PlayerCard Component:
```javascript
// PlayerCard only re-renders when its own data changes
const PlayerCard = React.memo(({ player }) => (
  <div className="player-card">
    <span className="player-name">{player.name || 'Player'}</span>
    <div className="player-stats">
      <span className="points">{player.points || 0} pts</span>
      <span className="fouls">{player.fouls || 0} fouls</span>
    </div>
  </div>
));
```

#### Disabled Layout Animations:
```javascript
<motion.div
  layout={false}  // ← Prevents Framer Motion from causing flicker
>
```

---

### 2. **LiveScoreboard.css** - Layout Stability

#### Prevented Layout Shifts:
```css
.team-score {
  min-width: 120px;  /* Score won't change width */
  display: inline-block;
  text-align: center;
}

.game-timer span {
  min-width: 100px;  /* Timer won't change width */
  display: inline-block;
  text-align: center;
}
```

#### GPU Acceleration Fixes:
```css
.live-scoreboard-container {
  will-change: auto;
  backface-visibility: hidden;
  transform: translateZ(0);
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
}

.player-card {
  will-change: auto;
  backface-visibility: hidden;
}
```

## 🧪 How to Test

1. **Start your app:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Open Admin Panel:**
   - Go to `/admin-scoring`
   - Login with password
   - Start a match

3. **Open Scoreboard:**
   - In another tab, go to `/schedule`
   - Watch the live scoreboard at the top

4. **Verify No Flickering:**
   - ✅ Timer counts down smoothly
   - ✅ Score updates are instant
   - ✅ Player stats update without flash
   - ✅ No visual jumps or shifts

---

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Change Detection Algorithm:
- Compares previous and current data
- Ignores `lastUpdated` timestamp
- Only updates on meaningful changes
- Timer updates separately without full re-render

### Memoization Strategy:
- `useMemo` for player lists
- `React.memo` for PlayerCard component
- Prevents recalculation unless dependencies change

### CSS Optimizations:
- Fixed widths prevent layout shifts
- GPU acceleration for smooth rendering
- Disabled problematic animations
