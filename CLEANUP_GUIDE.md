# Quick Fix: Remove Orphaned Match from Scoreboard

## The Problem
The HYD vs BOM match is showing on the scoreboard even though it's been deleted from the scheduler. This happened because it was deleted before the sync fix was implemented.

## The Solution - Use Admin Cleanup Tool

### Step 1: Access the Admin Cleanup Page
Go to: **https://internmimsbasketball.web.app/admin-cleanup**

### Step 2: Login
- **Password:** `admin2025` (or `scheduler2025` if that doesn't work)
- Click "Access Admin Tools"

### Step 3: Clean Up Orphaned Matches
1. You'll see two options:
   - **"Remove Orphaned Matches"** (RECOMMENDED) ✅
   - "Clear All Scoreboard Data" (Use only if you want to start fresh)

2. Click **"Clean Up Orphaned Matches"**

3. Confirm the action

4. Wait for the success message showing how many matches were removed

### Step 4: Verify
1. Go back to the scoreboard: https://internmimsbasketball.web.app/scoreboard
2. Refresh the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. The HYD vs BOM match should be GONE! ✅

## What This Tool Does

**"Remove Orphaned Matches"** (Safe Option):
- Compares matches in the scheduler (Firestore) vs scoreboard (Realtime Database)
- Removes only matches that have been deleted from scheduler but still show on scoreboard
- Keeps all valid matches intact

**"Clear All Scoreboard Data"** (Nuclear Option):
- Removes ALL matches from the scoreboard
- Use only if you want a completely clean slate

## Why This Happened

Your app uses two databases:
1. **Firestore** - Stores scheduled matches (used by Match Scheduler)
2. **Realtime Database** - Stores live scoreboard data (used by Live Scoreboard)

When you deleted HYD vs BOM before my fix, it was only removed from Firestore, leaving the data in Realtime Database. The cleanup tool removes this orphaned data.

## Future Deletions

**Good news!** After today's fix, when you delete a match from the scheduler, it will automatically:
- ✅ Remove from Firestore
- ✅ Remove from Realtime Database (current match if live)
- ✅ Remove from Realtime Database (completed matches)
- ✅ Disappear from the scoreboard instantly

You only needed this cleanup tool for the old orphaned data!

## Alternative: Manual Database Cleanup

If the tool doesn't work, you can manually clean the database:

1. Go to Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/internmimsbasketball/database
2. Navigate to: `internmimsbasketball-default-rtdb` → `Data`
3. Find: `matches/current` - Delete it if it shows HYD vs BOM
4. Find: `matches/completed` - Look for entries with HYD vs BOM and delete them
