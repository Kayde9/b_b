üîê QUICK START - Environment Setup
========================================

CRITICAL: You need to create environment files to run the app!

METHOD 1 - Automatic (Recommended for Windows):
-----------------------------------------------
Run this PowerShell script:
    .\create-env-files.ps1

If you get an error about execution policy:
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
    .\create-env-files.ps1


METHOD 2 - Manual:
------------------
1. Create a file named ".env" in the root directory
2. Copy the content from SECURITY_SETUP.md
3. Update scoreboard/js/firebase-config.js with actual values


VERIFY SETUP:
-------------
1. Check git status (these files should NOT appear):
   git status
   
   Expected: .env and firebase-config.js should be ignored

2. Start React app:
   npm start
   
   Expected: App starts without "Missing environment variables" error

3. Open scoreboard:
   Open scoreboard/index.html in browser
   
   Expected: No Firebase configuration errors


WHAT WAS FIXED:
---------------
‚úÖ Removed hardcoded credentials from source code
‚úÖ Added environment variable validation
‚úÖ Secured console logging (dev only)
‚úÖ Updated .gitignore to protect credentials
‚úÖ Created setup documentation


WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
--------------------
‚ö†Ô∏è  Create .env file (use create-env-files.ps1 or manual method)
‚ö†Ô∏è  Update Firebase database rules (see SECURITY_SETUP.md)


IMPORTANT SECURITY WARNING:
---------------------------
Your Firebase database currently allows ANYONE to write data!
This is a security risk. Please update your database rules.

See SECURITY_SETUP.md for detailed instructions.
